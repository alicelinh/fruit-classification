## Introduction
Fruit classification using computer vision has practical applications in agriculture, retail, and automated food processing, where accurate and efficient identification of fruit types is essential. This project explores the use of deep learning models to classify fruit images based on visual features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were developed using TensorFlow and Keras, with architectures including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50, VGG16, and DenseNet121. These models were trained and evaluated on a curated fruit image dataset to assess their performance in distinguishing between various fruit categories, aiming to support real-world deployment in smart farming, self-checkout systems, and supply chain automation.
